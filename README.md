# Messenger App

First Android project. 

Messenger app built in Kotlin, using recyclerview and Picasso for images. Firebase for auth, db and storage.

### Feature improvements
* ~~Bold text when message is unread~~
* Refactor to MVVM
* Add dependency injection and extract Firebase interaction to services to more easily swap backend
